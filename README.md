## Q1: Implementation of suffix array

### A. Given a string S print its minimum lexicographic rotation. O(nlogn)
### B. Given an integer K, print the length of the longest substring that appears in the text at least K times.If no such substring exist, print -1. O(nlogn)
### C. Given a strings S determine its longest substring that is also a palindrome. In the case of multiple solutions, print the lexicographically smallest palindrome. O(nlogn)

## Q2: Trie Implementation
### Given an array A of N numbers, you will be given q queries. Each query will contain a single integer x. You have to find then maximum xor of x from any number in A.

## Q3: External Sorting (: K-Way merge sort algorithm to sort a very large array)

### Input Constraints:
#### 1. A file containing a large unsorted list of integers (Will not fit in your usual Laptop RAM).
#### 2.Do not use any in-built data structures.
### Output: A file containing non-Descending sorted list of the given integers
