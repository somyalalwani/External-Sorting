# Data Structures & Algorithms for Problem Solving

##  Languages Used : C++

**PROBLEM : External Sorting** (K-Way merge sort algorithm to sort a very large array)

**AIM:** External Sorting is a class of algorithms used to deal with massive amounts of data that do not fit in memory.
The question aims at implementing one such type: K-Way merge sort algorithm to sort a very large array. This algorithm is a perfect example of the use of divide and conquer where with limited resources large problems are tackled by breaking the problem space into small computable subspaces and then operations are done on them.

**Input Constraints:**

1. A file containing a large unsorted list of integers (Will not fit in your usual Laptop RAM).
2.Do not use any in-built data structures.

**Output:** A file containing non-Descending sorted list of the given integers

**Evaluation parameters :**

1. Time and Space Complexity of the algorithm
2. Efficient use of Data-Structures

**Input Format:** Your code should take two arguments.

- First is the name of input file.
- Second is name of output file.
- Example Format: If your input file is at ./data/input.txt And if you need your output file at ./data/ named output.txt
    For c++, code should be of format code.cpp **compiled file should**
    **accept two arguments ./a.out “./data/input.txt” “./data/output.txt”**

**Generation of unsorted file:
To generate the unsorted file, python script is uploaded along with this pdf. It
contains all the instructions required to run it.**
